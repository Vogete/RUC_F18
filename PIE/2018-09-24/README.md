# Programming Interactive Experiences

## Make a google slides for your project

- [Project sketches](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R_T8GkNuVzdix63v0XO8bcUvWy5hcGUy)
- Make a copy of the following google slides document: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mbx4d8HAySLClRmQTNFvdojiz88cTsE-uSQ7vxdmI-k/edit?usp=sharing
- Put a link to the document in the brainstorming document.
- Make a list of three core questions or goals you want to archive with your project
- Find three core questions that you want to explore during the course. Here are some examples:
  - How can we make a lamp that is able to react to our habits in the house?
  - How can we create a lamp that follows that color temperature of the sun?
  - How can we create an info display that shows all our digital information in realtime?
  - How can we save energy by making users aware of their energy usage?
  - How can ambience be used as a way to indicate non-visible information?
- Put your goals with your vision in the project document
- Fill out as much as possible on from your google slides template for next time.
- Make a mockup of your idea
- Make a mockup of the physical form and how you want your interactions to be. This is not about making a perfect solution, but about ideation in materials. It is relevant to do multiple sketches and use your mockup as a basis to search through the ikea catalogue for interesting elements that can be used as a basis for your design. It is your job to go to ikea and buy the things you want to use. We will refund the money so be sure to keep the receipt. It is moreover important to check the budget with me.
- Take pictures of your mockup and put it in the project document.
- Begin making a working sketch
- Produce a working sketch which is good enough for testing.
